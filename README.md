# Choder - Chat for Coders

I wanted a private chat server to use with friends that had numerous features
that would facilitate working together on coding projects. All of the features
I desired exist in various forms spread among numerous services, but I wanted a
single, focused environment to take care of my needs that is not bound to the
browser. Privacy concerns and a few workflow convenience pet-peeves will hopefully
culminate in a handy collaboration platform for developers and designers.

This is an early work in progress.
